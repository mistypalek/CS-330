I approach designing software in finding something already in existence, and then adding or modifying the end result.  I like to find a basis foundation for my code, instead of writing the code from scratch.  I just find that most things have already have a good base to start from.  
I've learned many new design skills in this course, one of which is to apply textures to a shape to complete the look faster.  
The design process I followed was again to review existing code and change it to fit my needs.
The tactics I've used in this project can be used in the future, by reviewing existing code and modifying it for the current project.
I approach developing programs by having a good foundation to start from, with the correct libraries loaded, etc.  
I used several agile development strategies while working on my 3D scene.  Assuring I was planning for others to review my code in collaboration projects in the future.  My approcach to developing code evolved throughout the course by just learning more and more skills each module.
Computer Science can help me reach my goals, by allowing me to know how the foundation of programming is built and used to create amazing programs that we all use every single day.  I don't know that I will use the skills I've gained in this class in my future endeavors, but I definetly have more appreciation for those that will!
